Hello!<br>
Welcome to CoviBuddy â€“ Your Friend in Pandemic <br>
Since the start of the pandemic almost a year ago,  the  world has come to standstill. Some lost their jobs, some their family and friends. Almost everyone has been working from home. And students are attending online classes. Now, with the arrival  of second wave of pandemic, it is most unlikely that present situation would end soon. We are all passing through most difficult times.<br>
In the present hostile situation that we are living in, most of us are feeling sad, unhappy, lonely and insecured. <br>
 "CoviBuddy" is here as your most trusted friend. You can share your thoughts/feelings with us using the website. We will keep you updated on the COVID situation,  current government guidelines and  vaccination process. We even can entertain you when you are feeling bored and lonely or have nothing to do.<BR>

Stay Home , Stay Safe.
