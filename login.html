Hello!<br>
Welcome to CoviBuddy â€“ Your Friend in Pandemic <br>
Since the start of the pandemic almost a year ago, it is feeling like the whole world has come to a standstill. Some of us lost their job, some even lost their friends and family. Almost everyone has been working from home and students have been attending online classes. Now, with the threat of a second wave of pandemic, it is likely that these circumstances are not going to end soon.<br>
In these strange times, all of us felt sad, happy and lonely. <br>
To help you get through these tough times, CoviBuddy is here. You can share your thoughts with the world using the website as well as stay updated on the COVID situation like the current government guidelines and information on vaccination process using our COVID info feature. We even got you covered when you are feeling bored and have nothing to do.<BR>

Stay Home , Stay Safe.
